Notes on our mailing list based workflow

I wanted to gather some statistics regarding working on the mailing list
and wanted to share my insights.

I wrote a python script that essentially runs "git log --format='%ad %an %s'"
on both git.git as well as the mailing list with the intent to match up
commits to mails.

I tried using the subject lines as a dictionary key, only to find out
there are duplicates. 1318 commit subject lines occur in more than one commit
in git.git. From a cursory read, most of them are merges.

When accounting for merges by adding '--no-merges' to the invocation of
git-log, we're down to 491 subject lines that are not unique.

Looking at these non-uniques, a lot of them look like they were reverted
once and the re-introduced. An example from this year is Eliahs rename
detection series which was reverted and re-introduced, making ~20
subject lines not unique.

Another occurrence of these non-unique subject lines are either
re-occurring tasks (e.g. "l10n: de.po: fix typos",
"l10n: Update Swedish translation", "Update draft release notes to 2.2")

For further analysis I will ignore the effects of non-unique subject lines.

Then I tried matching subject lines of the mailing list to subject lines
of commits and counting how many such messages were on the mailing list.
When only stripping of the "[PATCH ...]" prefix, we get the following
count, occurrence:
0 10915
1 16644
2 5012
3 2312
4 996
5 533
6 277
7 220
8 124
9 77
10 35
11 13
12 11
13 14
14 6
15 3
16 8
17 9
18 11
19 3
20 4
21 3
22 11
23 1
27 1
74 1

The table indicates that we have 10915 commits in git.git that did not
have an accompanying email with the same subject on the mailing list;
16644 commits had exactly one match on the mailing list; 5012 commits
had 2 matches, and so on.

The multiple matches are due to resend, the no-matches are still
a bit of a mystery to me, as I do not suspect Junio to edit the
commit messages that often.

For the record of how I arrived at the numbers above, checkout
the commit which contains the report up to now and the scripts to produce
the numbers.
