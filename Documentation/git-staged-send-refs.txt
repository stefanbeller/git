NAME
----
git-staged-send-refs - Send ref updates over Git protocol to (multiple) other repositories


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git staged-send-refs' [--list] [--unstage [<repository-url>]]
		[--staged-receive-refs=<git-staged-receive-refs>] [--verbose]
		[--atomic-push-per-repo] [--atomic-push-all]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command is part of the supprot for performing atomic pushes/updates
across multiple repositories on the same server. Repositories are staged
for updates using the 'git push --staged-push' command and recorded in a
~/.gitstaging file for each user.

Once one or more remote repositories have been staged for update this command
is used to push and update all the refs that are staged. By default the command
will try to update every repository and every ref individually and the command
will report which repositories/refs was successfully updated and which
failed to update with the reason for the failure. This behaviour can be changed
using the --atomic-push-per-repo and --atomic-push-all arguments.

OPTIONS
-------
--staged-receive-refs=<git-staged-receive-refs>::
	Path to the 'git-staged-receive-refs' program on the remote
	end.  Sometimes useful when pushing to a remote
	repository over ssh, and you do not have the program in
	a directory on the default $PATH.

--exec=<git-staged-receive-refs>::
	Same as \--staged-receive-refs=<git-staged-receive-refs>.

--verbose::
	Run verbosely.

--list::
	Show the current content of the staging area. This command will list
	all repositories that are staged for update and for each repository
	it will show all the refs that will be updated.

--unstage [<respository-url>]::
	The unstage command is used to remove a previously staged
	repository from the staging area. When used without specifying
	a repository-url then all staged staged repositories will be removed.

--atomic-push-all::
	If the staging area contains multiple remote repositories, then
	perform the ref update for all repositories as one single atomic
	transaction. I.e. only perform the update if it can be applied
	successfully for all repositories and all refs. If any repository
	or ref fails then no update will be performed.

--atomic-push-per-repo::
	If the staging area contains multiple remote repositories, then
	update each repository independently as a transaction.
	In this more each individual repostirory will either succeed or fail
	to update independently of any other repositories.
